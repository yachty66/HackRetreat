# What
Participants are young, curious, creative and ambitious people who come together to work for one week on a technical project in a team with at least 2. For the HackRetreat participants rent a Airbnb for up to 15 people. Costs for living, food and other is equaly shared among the participants. Inspired by https://hacklodge.org/.

# Why

The goal is to meet new peers, enjoying the time of building something, finding interests for either founding or research. Through the fact of being together in the house for one week and intense nightly bug fixing people get really good to know each other.
